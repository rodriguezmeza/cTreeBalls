<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       cballs - 3 Point Correlation Function computation code


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>cballs</B> [ <I>parameter</I><B>_</B><I>file</I><B>_</B><I>name</I> ] [ <I>options</I> ]




</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>cballs</B> - computes the 3 point correlation function using tree methods,
       complexity O(N Log N).



</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       All the options have the structure

       <I>option</I><B>_</B><I>name</I>=&lt;option_value&gt;

       except option <B>-help</B>.


       Options and their possible values are:


       <B>-help</B>       By writting


                   cballs -help


                   you will get the list of all parameters and their default
                   values. An option may have an alias which is a short name
                   of the option. If an option has an alias in the list above
                   it comes after its description surrounded by brackets
                   tagged with 'a:'. For example,


                   option_name=&lt;option_value&gt;    ... Description ... [a: opt]

                   here 'opt' is the short name of the option. In the
                   description of the options below, when an option has an
                   alias it will be noted in the same way but before its
                   description.


       <B>paramfile</B>   is the name file with the values of the input parameters.
                   Overwrite parameters values below. You may input this
                   filename by only writing:

                   cballs paramfile=parameters_input_file_name

                   Parameter input file may be created by hand with the editor
                   of your choice. Comment lines start with an "%". Follow
                   each name option with a blank space and the option value.
                   The order of the option lines does not matter.  Also you
                   may create an example input file by executing

                   cballs

                   This will run the <B>cballs</B> code with default values and when
                   it finish you will have in your running output directory
                   the file "parameters_null-cballs-usedvalues". Now you may
                   edit this file to adapt to your own run parameters. This
                   file can be overwritten so it may be helpful to change this
                   file name to whatever apropriate.


       <B>searchMethod</B>
                   [a: search] is the searching method to use. Default is
                   "tree-omp-sincos". Other search options will be added in
                   the addons folder.


       <B>infile</B>      [a: in]  gives the name of file to input the data to
                   analyse.


       <B>testmodel</B>   [a: tstmodel] is the name of the model of data to create.
                   By default creates a box of random points.


       <B>mChebyshev</B>  [a: mcheb] is the total number of chebyshev multipoles to
                   use.


       <B>outfile</B>     [a: o] will give the name of file to save the analysed
                   data. The output is written in column form by default,
                   there is also a binary format. And by default this options
                   is empty then no output file is saved.


       <B>nbody</B>       is the total number of bodies to make as a test case. By
                   default a box of size given by <B>lengthBox</B> is created and
                   there <B>nbody</B> random points are generated. The random
                   generator is initialize with a seed given by <B>seed</B> option.


       <B>seed</B>        gives the seed to init the random generator.


       <B>lengthBox</B>   [a: lbox] is the length of the box side. The box is where
                   the bodies reside.


       <B>sizeHistN</B>   gives the number of bins to create.


       <B>rangeN</B>      is the maximum separtion of bodies to search for sampling.


       <B>stepState</B>   gives the frequency to save the the number of pivot
                   computed. Useful to see the state of the run.


       <B>verbose</B>     [a: verb] to print messages to stdout. There are three
                   levels of information. When is "0", no information is
                   written.


       <B>verbose_log</B> [a: verblog] to print messages to a log file (in directory
                   "tmp"). When is "0" no information is written.


       <B>options</B>     [a: opt] you may give here various code behavior options.



</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       time ../cballs nbody=100000 rangeN=500 sizeHistN=100 lbox=10000 verb=2
       o=outdata


       You will have computation written in a file named with option <B>outfile</B>
       in a directory named Output. If this directory does not exist, it will
       be created.  Also will be created a directory named "tmp" in the folder
       Output, where a log file will be saved.


       Reading a Takahasi simulation data file downsized to 512:


       time cballs infile=./full_sky_whole_XYZK__zs9_r000_nside512.bin
       infmt=binary options=stop


       To convert a catalog from binary to ascii do:


       cballs in=./full_sky_whole_XYZK__zs9_r000_nside512.bin infmt=binary
       o=takas options=convert
